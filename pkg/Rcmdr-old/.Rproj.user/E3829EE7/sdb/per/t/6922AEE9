The menus provided by a plug-in package are\nmerged with the standard Commander menus. It is also possible to remove menus\nand menu items from the standard Commander menu file or from the files of\nplug-ins installed before the current one.\n\nPlug-in packages given in the R Commander \\code{plugins} option \n(see \\code{\\link{Commander}}) are automatically loaded when the Commander\nstarts up. Plug-in packages may also be loaded via the Commander\n\\emph{Tools -> Load Rcmdr plug-in(s)} menu; a restart of the Commander is\nrequired to install the new menus. Finally, loading a plug-in package when\nthe \\pkg{Rcmdr} is not loaded will load the \\pkg{Rcmdr} and activate the\nplug-in.\n\nAn illustrative R Commander plug-in package, \\pkg{RcmdrPlugin.TeachingDemos}, is\navailable on CRAN.\n\nA variety of utility functions is available to support R Commander plug-in packages;\nsee \\code{\\link{Rcmdr.Utilities}}.\n\nFor more details, see Fox, \\emph{Writing R Commander Plug-in Packages} at \\url{http://socserv.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Books/RCommander/Writing-Rcmdr-Plugins.pdf}.\n}\n\n\\seealso{\\code{\\link{Commander}}, \\code{\\link{Rcmdr.Utilities}}}\n\n\\keyword{misc}\n",
