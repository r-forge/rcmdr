  o Improvements to plotMeans() legends.
  
  o Barplot() can now compute conditional percentages (suggestion of Beatriz Lacruz); other improvements.
  
  o Hist() now invisibly returns a "hist" object or list of "hist" objects (suggestion of Beatriz Lacruz).
  
  o renamed bin.var() as binVariable(), retaining bin.var() as a synomym.
  
  o Added discretePlot() for plotting distributions of discrete numeric variables (after a suggestion of Beatriz Lacruz).
  
  o Added plotBoot() for plotting bootstrap distributions.
  
  o indexplot() can now plot multiple variables (suggestion of Manuel Munoz).
  
  o Added binnedCounts() for binned frequency distribution of a numeric variable (suggestion of Manuel Munoz).
  
  o Added normalityTests() for various tests of normality.
  
  o Small bug fixes.

Changes to Version 1.0-5

  o Added connect argument to plotMeans() (suggestion of Graham Smith).
  
  o Added capability to plot regions under density functions to plotDistr().
  
  o Added *gumbel() functions for the Gumbel distribution, parametrized by location and scale.

Changes to Version 1.0-4

  o Added ... argument to Barplot (after Rcmdr bug reported by Fritz Leisch).
  
  o Added DeltaMethod().

Changes to Version 1.0-3
