You can edit this R Markdown document. 

It's generally not a good idea to edit the R code that the R Commander writes, 
but you can freely edit between R "code blocks" (which appear between ```{r} 
and ```), for example to explain what you're doing and to draw conclusions 
from your data analysis.

Autogenerated section titles, typically preceded by ###, can also be edited.
